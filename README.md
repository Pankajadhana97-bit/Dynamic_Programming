# Dynamic_Programming
Dynamic Programming questions Only
This comprises of the codes of the Aditya verma's playlist of the dynamic programming 

comprises of 1. -> brute force (Recursive code );
             2. -> optimised   (recursive + Memoized );
						 3, -> top-down    (store subproblems in the matrix);

getting started with
     (1.) 01knapsack  -------->
            1.Recursive approach("if the wight is less than total weight then pick value else not")
						2.Memoization store the calls for using in next time 
						3. top down approach to store calls in a matrix iteratively 

		 (2.) Subset sum problem -->
